# Alnilam-60

typical plain-c with the twist of supporting Alps and a weird 8u, flipped Iso-Enter layout The outlines and mounting hole positions were taken from the [bakeneko60](https://github.com/kkatano/bakeneko-60) and [Plain-C](https://github.com/evyd13/plain60-c)

### Current Status: Prototypes arrived; fully tested and working 

- Case Design in Progress // not tested

## Alnilam-60:

the compromise of 65% and 50% keyboards within my  three-board-series named after the three bright stars forming the omnipresent orion belt you can perceive within the night. While it is your normal 60% keyboard with ALPS-support, it also features a unique, trash-layout which is only useable, if you own a flipped ISO-Enter key, and 8u spacebar, thats why it exists.

If you wish to order your own pcb and case, you can find all the necessary files within this repository
